# activity-tracker

This is my C# project for Code Louisville. This project is an attempt to keep track of one's productivity by displaying time spent out of the day performing a certain task and how many hours are remaining out of the day for other tasks.

The features I plan to implement are:

Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
