# activity-tracker

This is my C# project for Code Louisville. This project is an attempt to keep track of one's productivity by displaying time spent out of the day performing a certain task and how much time is remaining out of the day for other tasks.

The features I plan to implement are:

  1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
  2. Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
  3. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
